# Architecture Overview

## Philosophy

Meterplex follows the **modular monolith** pattern - a single deployable NestJS application with strict module boundaries enforced by the framework's dependency injection system.

### Why not microservices?

Microservices on day one create a **distributed monolith** - the worst of both worlds. You get the operational complexity of multiple services (separate deployments, inter-service communication, distributed tracing) without the benefits (independent scaling, isolated failures), because the domain boundaries haven't been proven yet.

The modular monolith gives us:

- **One deployment** - simpler CI/CD, one Docker image, one health check
- **In-process calls** - no network latency between modules, no serialization overhead
- **Shared database** - transactions span modules, no eventual consistency headaches
- **Clean extraction path** - when a module needs independent scaling, extract it. Kafka topics are already in place for async communication

### When to extract a microservice

A module becomes a microservice candidate when:

1. It needs to scale independently (usage ingestion handles 100x more load than billing)
2. It has a different deployment cadence (billing changes weekly, usage is stable)
3. It requires a different runtime (ML scoring in Python, not TypeScript)

Until then, modules stay in the monolith.

## Module Dependency Rules

```text
AppModule
├── ConfigModule (global)     - env validation, ConfigService
├── PrismaModule (global)     - database access
├── HealthModule              - /health endpoint
└── Feature Modules
    ├── TenantsModule          - tenant CRUD
    ├── UsageModule            - usage event ingestion
    ├── BillingModule          - invoice generation
    └── ...
```

**Rules:**

- Feature modules may depend on `ConfigModule` and `PrismaModule` (global)
- Feature modules communicate through **exported services**, not internal imports
- No circular dependencies between feature modules
- If Module A needs data from Module B, Module B exports a service that Module A imports

## Infrastructure

Meterplex follows a **"Performance-First"** infrastructure philosophy. For local development, we use Docker Compose with several high-efficiency strategies:

| Service          | Container            | Port | Purpose                              |
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :--- | :----------------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL 18    | `meterplex-postgres` | 5432 | Primary data store                   |
| Apache Kafka 4.2 | `meterplex-kafka`    | 9092 | Event streaming (KRaft Mode)         |
| Redis 8          | `meterplex-redis`    | 6379 | Cache and rate limiting              |
| Kafka UI         | `meterplex-kafka-ui` | 9000 | Debug interface (Dormant by default) |

### Key Infrastructure Principles

1. **KRaft Native**: We use Kafka 4.2+ in KRaft mode. This eliminates the Zookeeper dependency, reducing the local footprint and speeding up startup times.
2. **"Zero-Tax" Tooling**: High-resource tools like Kafka UI are moved to a **Docker Profile** (`debug`). They consume **0% CPU** by default and are only started when explicitly requested via `pnpm docker:ui`.
3. **Isolated Networking**: All containers communicate over a dedicated `meterplex-internal` bridge network. This provides faster DNS resolution and ensures the infrastructure is isolated from other projects running on the host.
4. **Hardware-Native**: We prioritize Alpine-based images and native ARM64 support to ensure 100% performance on modern silicon (Apple M-series).

In production, these services are typically replaced by cloud-native managed solutions (e.g., AWS RDS, MSK, and ElastiCache).

## Phase 1 - Data model

![Phase 1 ERD](phase-1-erd.png)

Four tables: `tenants` (organizations), `users` (global accounts), `memberships` (join table with roles), and `api_keys` (server-to-server authentication). A user can belong to multiple tenants with different roles via the memberships table.
