/**
 * AuditLogInterceptor - Automatically logs every mutation to the audit_logs table.
 *
 * How it works:
 *   1. Runs AFTER the route handler completes (in the response pipeline)
 *   2. Checks if the request is a mutation (POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE)
 *   3. Extracts: who (actor), what (resource + action), where (tenant)
 *   4. Writes an immutable audit record to Postgres
 *   5. Fire-and-forget - audit failures are logged but never block the response
 *
 * What it skips:
 *   - GET, HEAD, OPTIONS requests (reads don't mutate)
 *   - Health checks (/health)
 *   - Auth endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/refresh, etc.)
 *     These have their own security logging concerns
 *
 * How resource detection works:
 *   The interceptor infers the resource type from the URL path:
 *     /api/v1/tenants     → resource = "tenant"
 *     /api/v1/users       → resource = "user"
 *     /api/v1/api-keys    → resource = "api_key"
 *
 *   The resource ID comes from:
 *     - Route params (:id) for UPDATE/DELETE
 *     - Response body (id field) for CREATE
 *
 * How actor detection works:
 *   - JWT auth: request.user.id → actorType = USER
 *   - API key auth: request.apiKeyId → actorType = API_KEY
 *   - Neither: actorType = SYSTEM (shouldn't happen on guarded routes)
 *
 * Why fire-and-forget?
 *   Audit logging is important but not critical-path. If the database
 *   write fails (e.g., Postgres is overloaded), the user's request
 *   should still succeed. The failure is logged to stdout where
 *   Loki/ELK will catch it in Phase 7.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   Applied globally in main.ts - no per-controller decoration needed.
 *   To skip a specific route, use the @SkipAudit() decorator.
