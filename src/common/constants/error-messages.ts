/**
 * Centralized error messages used across the application.
 *
 * Why centralize?
 *   - Frontend can match on error codes programmatically
 *   - Consistent wording across all modules
 *   - Easy to find and update all error messages in one place
 *   - Enables i18n (internationalization) later if needed
 *
 * Convention:
 *   - Group by module (TENANT, USER, AUTH, API_KEY)
 *   - Use functions for messages that include dynamic values
 *   - Keep messages user-friendly, not developer-internal
